## Issues

Some tips on good issue reporting:

* When describing issues try to phrase your issue in terms of the *behavior* you think needs changing rather than the *code* you think need changing.
* Search the issue list first for related items, and make sure you're running the latest version before reporting an issue.
* If reporting a bug, then try to include a pull request with a failing test case.  This will help us quickly identify if there is a valid issue, and make sure that it gets fixed more quickly if there is one.
* Closing an issue doesn't necessarily mean the end of a discussion.  If you believe your issue has been closed incorrectly, explain why and we'll consider if it needs to be reopened.
