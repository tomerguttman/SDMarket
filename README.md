# Intro
The cost of living is a significant economic burden on more and more people in the world. One of the means to alleviate the cost of living is the ability to check and compare prices in a convenient and easy way, which allows for wise consumer purchase of any basket of products.

The development of the world and technology makes it possible to bring together sellers (Stores) and shoppers, and create a digital arena in which the consumer can, on the one hand, make quick and easy price comparisons, and on the other hand, create exposure of stores to different consumers who were previously unaware of their existence.
